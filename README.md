# 🌱 Conway's Game of Life

# 📜 About

This is a terminal-based implementation of Conway’s Game of Life, built entirely from scratch in C. No fancy UI, just pure logic and a mesmerizing display of cellular automaton evolution right in your terminal.

# Features:

📡 Simple yet captivating simulation.

⏳ Runs infinitely (until you stop it).

🖥️ Terminal-based display.

⚙️ Customizable grid size.

🔬 How It Works

# The game follows four simple rules:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).

Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.

Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).
